
Logic when adding to the root levels:

add (oid, hash, level)


find last bucket for level 
  - found:
    add oid and hash to it
      if overflow ?
        make sibling        
		add oid and hash to sibling
	    recalculate subling's hash

        does last bucket have a parent?
          no has no parent:       
            make parent
            point last bucket to parent
            add last buckets' info to parent
    		add siblings' info the parent
          yes has a parent:
            parent = add(sibling.oid, sibling.hash, level+1)
	        point new sibling bucket to parent

	  no overflow:				      
	    recalculate it's hash
    bubble up the master hashes
    
  - not found:
    make a new bucket
    add oid and hash to it
    recalculate it's hash
